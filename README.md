# PCBuildingSim-3DMark-Calculator
Program to calculate all of the CPU/GPU combinations that achieve a certain 3DMark score. Note that other hardware in your in-game computer can also _slightly_ boost your score.

First of all, please read ```ATTRIBUTIONS.txt``` to see the data I built this project off of.

**Project Overview**

The ```main.py``` file is the main source code for the program. You can just run it directly if you don't want to run the .exe file (found in releases). The two CSV files, ```GPUReal.csv``` and ```CPUReal.csv``` contain all of the 3DMark data for each GPU and CPU respectively, in (name),(cost),(score) format. These files are necessary for the program to function, and should be in the same directory as ```main.py```.

**How it Works**

The program first prompts you for a few filters to narrow down the results you get. It firsts ask for a minumum 3DMark score threshhold that you want to achieve. Note that other hardware in-game can also _slightly_ boost your 3DMark score, so it may be a good idea to shoot for a slightly lower score using this filter. It then asks for a certain GPU and certain CPU that you want to filter by. These filters are not case-sensitive but **are** whitespace-sensitive. They are also optional, and simply clicking enter and skipping by them will bypass the filter.

The program will then loop through every single CPU and GPU combination and find their combined 3DMark score using the formula ```1/((.85/gpu_score) + (.15/cpuscore))``` found in the original google doc (see ```ATTRIBUTIONS.txt```).

After the program finishes, it creates a ```Results.txt``` in the same directory as ```main.py```. Here, it lists every CPU and GPU combination that fits the provided filters, including their combined score.
